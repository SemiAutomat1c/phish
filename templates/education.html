            <h2>What Happened?</h2>
            <p>This was a simulated phishing attempt. In a real attack, your credentials would now be in the hands of attackers.</p>
            
            <h2>Red Flags You Should Have Noticed:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The URL in your address bar wasn't the official Google domain</li>
                <li>There was no HTTPS security indicator</li>
                <li>The page may have had subtle differences from the real login page</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How to Protect Yourself:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always check the URL before entering credentials</li>
                <li>Look for HTTPS and the lock icon in your browser</li>
                <li>Enable two-factor authentication when possible</li>
                <li>Use a password manager to avoid manually typing passwords</li>
            </ul>
